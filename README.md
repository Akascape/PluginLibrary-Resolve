## What is this?
This is simply a script for Davinci Resolve which opens up a window that contains a **list** of all my commercial and free plugins.
<br> **Features:**
- Directly open up the installed plugins
- Search and filter the plugins
- Get news and offer
- Easy Interface
- Get direct links of my products
- More coming soon...

## What it's not?
Currently this app doesn't download any of my fuse plugin files or macros. This is a showcase application which will help users to search my scripts which are already installed on their system. My Resolve plugins can be downloaded from my store: https://akascape.gumroad.com/

But userbase and update system implementation is on the roadmap!

## How to Install?
- Download the installer lua script from the releases:

- Drag and drop this file in the fusion of page of resolve
- Wait for the installtion process, then click on `WorkSpace>Scripts>Akascape>Library` to open the app

_Requirements: Davinci Resolve 16+ (Free or Studio) or any Fusion Studio_
Update: Davinci Resolve 19.1+ (Free version) has removed access to the Resolve UI manager API, so use any older version of Resolve to use this script.
