# My PluginLibrary for Resolve

## What is this?
This is simply a script for Resolve which opens up a window which contains **a list** of all my commercial and free plugins.
Features:
- Directly open up the installed plugins
- Search and filter different plugins
- Get news and offer
- Get links of my products
- More coming soon...

## What it's not?
This app doesn't contains any of my fuse plugin files or macros. This is just a showcase application which will help users to find my scripts which are installed on their system. My Resolve plugins can be downloaded from here: https://akascape.gumroad.com/
