# My PluginLibrary for Resolve

## What is this?
This is simply a script for Resolve which opens up a window that contains a **list** of all my commercial and free plugins.
<br> **Features:**
- Directly open up the installed plugins
- Search and filter the plugins
- Get news and offer
- Easy Interface
- Get direct links of my products
- More coming soon...

## What it's not?
Currently this app doesn't download any of my fuse plugin files or macros. This is just a showcase application which will help users to search my scripts which are already installed on their system. My Resolve plugins can be downloaded from my store: https://akascape.gumroad.com/

But userbase and update system implementation is on the roadmap!
