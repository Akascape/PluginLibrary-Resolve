This is a script that changes the title bar color of Davinci Resolve in Windows, which is white by default.
### Why? Because we like full Dark-Mode

Add this script in the `comp` folder of Davinci Resolve.

[![Download Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Custom_Title_Bar.lua-brightgreen.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akascape/PluginLibrary-Resolve/refs/heads/scripts/CustomTitleBar/Custom%20Title%20Bar.lua)

Open the script through `Workspace>Scripts>Comp>Custom Title Bar` menu.

Note: 
- Some modes may not work in windows 10.
- Currently this script can't be automated at startup; if anyone know how to automate scripts after opening a project then please let me know.
